### 💻 The technical

Show us the code! We've put together a technical test below to help you show the best of who you are to us. This is what you need to do.

We'd like you to build a basic React Native app that utilises the Etherspot platform with one screen minimum (you can add more if you think it works for your app), an input for an Ethereum address and a numberical input for the send amount.

**About the Etherspot Platform**

The Etherspot Platform allows developers and organisations to quickly bootstrap their apps and dApps, with contract management and blockchain interaction handled by the platform itself. All interaction of the Etherspot Platform is handled by the Etherspot SDK. Here are some links that you may find useful:

- [Etherspot Documentation](https://docs.etherspot.dev)
- [Etherspot SDK Playground](https://try.etherspot.dev)
- [Etherspot SDK Reference](https://sdk.etherspot.dev)
- [Etherspot Website](https://etherspot.io)

🚏 As part of the React Native app, there are two user journeys:

1. The user can see their ETH balance
2. The user can send their ETH balance to another address

🛠 When building the app, please use these pointers below:

- Use ethers.js
- Use a free Infura node to fetch ETH balance and send transactions
- Use the Ropsten testnet, 
you can get free ETH on Ropsten here: https://faucet.ropsten.be/
- Show ETH balance on the screen
- Optional: Allow the user the ability to save and restore their wallet

Of course there's no hard and fast rule into how you develop your app, but we would recommend these guidelines:

- Don't overengineer
- Don't re-invent the wheel where you don't need to
- Don't spend more than an hour on this, but of course if you want to spend more time on this - we won't stop you
- Do keep it simple
- Do include something that you might think will impress us
- Do annotate your code and explain your thought process
