### 💻 The technical

Show us the code! We've put together a technical test below to help you show the best of who you are to us. This is what you need to do.

We'd like you to build a basic React Native app with one screen and an input for an Ethereum address and a numberical input.

🚏 As part of the React Native app, there are two user journeys:

1. The user can see their ETH balance
2. The user can send their ETH balance to another address

🛠 When building the app, please use these pointers below:

- Use ethers.js
- Use a free Infura node to fetch ETH balance and send transactions
- Use the Ropsten testnet, 
you can get free ETH on Ropsten here: https://faucet.ropsten.be/
- Show ETH balance on the screen
- Optional: Allow the user the ability to save and restore their wallet

Of course there's no hard and fast rule into how you develop your app, but we would recommend these guidelines:

- Don't overengineer
- Don't re-invent the wheel where you don't need to
- Don't spend more than an hour on this, but of course if you want to spend more time on this - we won't stop you
- Do keep it simple
- Do include something that you might think will impress us
- Do annotate your code and explain your thought process

### 📚 Reference
Here's a few references to get you started:

- [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)
- [Infura](https://infura.io/)
- [Create React Native App](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
- [Free Ropsten ETH](https://faucet.ropsten.be/)

### 🏆 Submitting your app

When you're finished, please upload it to a Github repository and get in touch with us [on Discord](https://chat.pillar.fi) or drop an [email here](mailto:kieran@pillarproject.io?subject=App%20Submission).

Thanks for taking an interest and we can't wait to see what you bring!

To the moon 🚀🌙
