From there, it transformed into a solution that leveraged yield farming strategies to increase the returns offered to users.",
        "howDoesRariEarn": "Currently, the product optimizes for yield across a series of stable-assets (swapping via 0x) in the stable and yield pools and Ethereum in the ETH pool. It earns yield by lending and farming across various DeFi protocols like Compound, dYdX, KeeperDAO, mStable, yEarn, and Aave. We are actively expanding our strategy set to focus on more sustainable yields off of the chain. We expect lending to compose the minority of the pool's allocation once mass protocol expansion has begun.",
        "rariPools": "The first pool is the stable pool ($RSPT) which interacts safely with exclusively audited contracts. The next pool is the yield pool ($RYPT) that will maximize for yield at all costs, whether it is leverage or unaudited contracts--the yield pool will always have the highest returns. Lastly, the ETH ($REPT) fund will work to deliver safe and stable returns with ETH as the base asset. ",
        "deposits": "Only certain stablecoins are accepted for direct deposits (direct meaning without exchange to an accepted currency). To deposit another currency, you must exchange your funds before depositing. Fortunately, Rari can exchange and deposit your funds in the same transaction via 0x and/or mStable (please be aware that exchanges via 0x are subject to slippage due to price spread as well as an ETH protocol fee, and exchanges via mStable are subject to a small denominational percentage fee, but can avoid slippage and even get you a bonus).\n\nSee USAGE.md for more information on how to deposit via the smart contracts and API.md for a detailed reference on the smart contract methods involved. See the Rari SDK for easy implementation and the web client for easy usage.",

Users can also delegate their voting power to another address to pool voting power.\n\n$RGT enables transaction discounts for users, a unique feature of $RGT and the Rari Protocol. By staking held $RGT tokens in Rari, users can gain discounts on Rari Protocol fees. Rari normally charges a 9.5% fee on all gains, however, staking $RGT can reduce these fees over certain intervals. Fees accumulate through time and discounts are determined by the ratio between deposited funds to staked $RGT. ",

        "howDoLiquidityPoolsWork": "In its basic form, a single liquidity pool holds 2 tokens and each pool creates a new market for that particular pair of tokens. DAI/ETH can be a good example of a popular liquidity pool on Uniswap.\n\nWhen a new pool is created, the first liquidity provider is the one that sets the initial price of the assets in the pool. The liquidity provider is incentivised to supply an equal value of both tokens to the pool. If the initial price of the tokens in the pool diverges from the current global market price, it creates an instant arbitrage opportunity that can result in lost capital for the liquidity provider. This concept of supplying tokens in a correct ratio remains the same for all the other liquidity providers that are willing to add more funds to the pool later.\n\nWhen liquidity is supplied to a pool, the liquidity provider (LP) receives special tokens called LP tokens in proportion to how much liquidity they supplied to the pool. When a trade is facilitated by the pool a 0.3% fee is proportionally distributed amongst all the LP token holders. If the liquidity provider wants to get their underlying liquidity back, plus any accrued fees, they must burn their LP tokens.\n\nEach token swap that a liquidity pool facilitates results in a price adjustment according to a deterministic pricing algorithm. This mechanism is also called an automated market maker (AMM) and liquidity pools across different protocols may use a slightly different algorithm."
