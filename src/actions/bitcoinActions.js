/*
 * Since our main target on this project is ETH, here are some insights
 * on the expected behaviour and the approach we're taking based on what
 * we understand for Bitcoin.
 *
 * Privacy:
 *
 *   In Bitcoin, privacy is really important, so there are many conventions
 *   and design decisions to protect users privacy as much as possible.
 *   Althought we can never guarantee transactions will not be traced back
 *   to anyone, we have to make sure we take into consideration the
 *   community standards for such purpose.
 *
 *   One of the conventions, is to use each address just once. Even tho in
 *   this first approach we're gonna be reusing addresses to avoid extra
 *   complexity during the MVP testing, there are many things we need to
 *   change to protect our users privacy when the feature is released to
 *   the public.
 *
 * Receiving funds:
 *
 *   When the user wants to receive funds, we'd need to derive a new address
 *   and provide it to them. Right now, we're gonna be using a single address
 *   for all the flows.
 *
 * Transactions:
 *
 *   Bitcoin transactions have outputs that indicate where the funds go to. They
 *   have each an output index inside the transaction, an amount and a destination
 *   address: [outid, amount, address].
 *
 *   The input of a transaction is a set of references to outputs from previous
 *   transactions, as a list of [transaction, outid], and the amount is simply the
 *   sum of the amounts for all used outputs.
 *   Any amount that is not sent to any address is considered miner fee. So the
 *   fee would be something like: sum(inputs) - sum(outputs)
 *
 * Calculating address balance:
 *
 *   After an address has received some transactions, it will have available
 *   outputs, that are not spent (not used by any transaction). We call those
 *   unspent outputs "utxos".
 *
 *   Then, the address balance is just the sum of the outputs it can spend,
 *   i.e. the sum of amounts on the uxtos it has.
 *
 * Sending transactions:
 *
 *   When sending a transaction, we need to choose among the available utxos, and
 *   use as many as needed to cover the amount we want to send. There are many
 *   strategies that can be used to select the outputs to use, each with its own
 *   advantages/disadvantages. We're gonna be using the coinselect's default
 *   implementation and see how it goes.
 *
 *   It is important that the utxos are updated when sending a transaction, since
 *   they can't be used twice (it'll result on a double spend error).
 *
 *   Since outputs are used entirely, if the total value is less than what we
 *   want to send, we need to provide what's called "change" address. That address
 *   can be the same address that's sending the funds, but that represents a
 *   privacy issue so a new adress should be created each time. Change addresses
 *   have nothing special other than its conventional name, they are regular
 *   addresses.
 *
 *   A transaction chain would (on a very basic view) look something like:
 *
 *     // Initial with 100 for each 'abc' and 'bcd':
 *     [tx: '0001'] -> {
 *       inputs: [ ... ],
 *       outputs: [
 *         { id: 0, amount: 100, address: 'abc' }, // 100 to 'abc'
 *         { id: 1, amount: 100, address: 'bcd' }, // 100 to 'bcd'
 *       ],
 *     }
 *
 *     // Sending 50 from 'abc' to 'cde':
 *     [tx: '0002'] -> {
 *       inputs: [
 *         { txid: '0001', out: 0 }, // output for 'abc' (total 100)
 *       ]
 *       outputs: [
 *         { id: 0, amount: 50, address: 'cde' }, // 50 to 'cde'
 *         { id: 1, amount: 40, address: 'def' }, // 40 to change address
 *         // We leave 10 unspent for miner fee
 *       ]
 *     }
 *
 *     // Sending 40 from 'bcd' to 'efg':
 *     [tx: '0003'] -> {
 *       inputs: [
 *         { txid: '0001', out: 1 }, // output for 'bcd' (total 100)
 *       ]
 *       outputs: [
 *         { id: 0, amount: 40, address: 'efg' }, // 40 to 'efg'
 *         { id: 1, amount: 40, address: 'fgh' }, // change address
 *         // We leave 20 unspent for miner fee
 *       ]
 *     }
 *
 *     // We can also send from multiple inputs:
 *     [tx: '0004'] -> {
 *       inputs: [
 *         { txid: '0002', out: 0 }, // from 'cde' (total 50)
 *         { txid: '0002', out: 1 }, // from 'def' (total 40)
 *         { txid: '0003', out: 0 }, // from 'efg' (total 40)
 *         // inputs total: 130
 *       ]
 *       outputs: [
 *         { id: 0, amount: 60, address: 'ghi' }, // 60 to 'ghi'
 *         { id: 1, amount: 60, address: 'hij' }, // 60 to 'hij'
 *         // We leave 10 unspent for miner fee
 *       ]
 *     }
