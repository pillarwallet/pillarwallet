Having already implemented Industry 4.0 technology, robotics and integrated digitalisation, Dentaprime offers the highest quality dentistry affordable to all people, regardless of their income.\nThe Dentacoin ERC20 token is configured to be used globally by all individuals.\nDentacoin Fundation, the DCN inventor, bought 100% of Dentaprime International PLCs&rsquo; shares thus the disposition over the company will be in the hands of Dentacoin Foundation and will be connected to the blockchain.\nEach DCN represents and participates in the company&rsquo;s shares and dividends. The DCN community will vote for important decisions of the company through an integrated voting system.\nFurther projects are planned:\nThe health data base: In addition to the currency (DCN), the Ethereum blockchain will securely handle all private patient data. Further data will be updatable and accessible to patients.\nThe Insurance: Following treatment, Dentaprime will offer each patient a DCN paid insurance policy for lifelong free dental procedures to prevent all the health consequences related to old-age poverty.\nDentacoin will develop as both, a stable growing international currency and an attractive alternate derivate system for investors.","links":[{"Bitcointalk":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1944236.0"},{"Blog":"https://www.dentacoin.com/blog/"},{"CoinMarketCap":"dentacoin"},{"Email":"mailto:admin@dentacoin.com"},{"Facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/dentacoin/"},{"Github":"https://github.com/Dentacoin"},{"Reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentacoin/"},{"Slack":"https://dentacoin.slack.com/"},{"Twitter":"https://twitter.com/dentacoin"},{"Website":"https://dentacoin.com/"},{"Whitepaper":"https://www.dentacoin.com/white-paper/Whitepaper-en%20v.1.0.pdf"}],"name":"Dentacoin","symbol":"٨"},{"addr":"0x08f5a9235b08173b7569f83645d2c7fb55e8ccd8","decimals":8,"description":"Tierion is using the blockchain to transform how the world secures and shares data.","links":[{"Bitcointalk":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2027510.0"},{"Blog":"https://medium.com/@WayneVaughan"},{"CoinMarketCap":"tierion"},{"Email":"mailto:tokensale@tierion.com"},{"Facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/TierionInc/"},{"Github":"https://github.com/Tierion"},{"Reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/tierion/"},{"Telegram":"https://t.me/tierion"},{"Twitter":"https://twitter.com/Tierion"},{"Website":"https://tokensale.tierion.com/"},{"Website":"https://tierion.com/"},{"Whitepaper":"https://tokensale.tierion.com/whitepaper"}],"name":"Tierion Network Token","symbol":"TNT"},{"addr":"0x08f8117155aa9414b67113a47ad269d47974e9dc","decimals":18,"description":"On traditional server architectures, every aplication need to set up its own servers that run their own code in isolated silos, making sharing of data hard.

This ensures that the data is securely stored in a decentralized manner that exhibits great redundancy and failure resistance. The Oyster Pearl(PRL) is an ERC20 token that exhibits unique qualities that are built upon the smart contract framework of Ethereum. Oyster nodes hunt for Pearls that are embedded across file data structures that are retained on the Tangle. As the nodes search for Pearls via Proof of Work they inadvertently maintain the data on the Tangle, therefore securing it's retention. The Oyster smart contract only allows Pearls to be gradually released from their embedded state, therefore guaranteeing the data's integrity for the correct amount of time.","links":[{"Blog":"https://medium.com/oysterprotocol"},{"CoinMarketCap":"oyster-pearl"},{"Email":"mailto:contact@oyster.ws"},{"Github":"https://github.com/oysterprotocol"},{"Telegram":"https://t.me/oysterprotocol"},{"Twitter":"https://twitter.com/OysterProtocol"},{"Website":"https://oysterprotocol.com/"},{"Website":"https://oyster.ws/"},{"Whitepaper":"https://oyster.ws/OysterWhitepaper.pdf"}],"name":"Oyster Pearl","symbol":"PRL"},{"__FORKDELTA_CUSTOM_SYMBOL":"READ","addr":"0x189c05c3c191015c694032e1b09c190d5db3fb50","decimals":8,"description":"Readcoin is a decentralized ecosystem enabling the re-bundling of valuable content to media identity.

Cameras will be placed in all living areas, party and bar areas, swimming pool, gym and spa areas, the outdoor kitchen and hot tub area and in the bedrooms and bathrooms all of which broadcast live pictures and audio to our paying customers. Within the house we will also have up to 30 Live Show rooms. These live show rooms are private rooms where our models perform on camera broadcast to a live audience. Viewers can chat in an open chat room and tip the model at anytime or they can engage in a private show with the model. It is the profit derived from these Live Show rooms that will be distributed quarterly to ROC token holders. Members can vote on what type of weekly party will take place in the house, they can choose for their favourite model to take yoga classes, painting or piano lessons, they can buy roses, perfume and other gifts or they can send their favourite model a bottle of wine and a box of chocolates allowing our members to interact with our models in many different ways.

Our vision is to take Ethereum to the next level as a financial asset.","links":[{"Bitcointalk":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2372592.msg24198861#msg24198861"},{"Facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/ethereumx/"},{"Telegram":"https://t.me/Ethereum_X"},{"Twitter":"https://twitter.com/Ethereum_X_io"},{"Website":"http://ethereumx.io/"}],"name":"Ethereum X","symbol":"ETHX"},{"addr":"0x49aec0752e68d0282db544c677f6ba407ba17ed7","decimals":18,"description":"Billionaire Token (XBL) is designed and tailored specifically for the gamblers and the smart investors in the crypto world.
